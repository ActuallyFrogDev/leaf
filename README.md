# leaf

Leaf is a package manager for Linux that is meant to be **simple, user-friendly, and easy-to-use.**

## Installation

**NOTE: The only supported distros now are Arch, Debian, Ubuntu, and Nix. If you have a different distro, you will have to do a Manual Installation.**

Installation is as easy as just running this command in your Linux terminal:

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://leaf.treelinux.org/install/install.sh)"`

And **boom**! No pain, no troubleshooting; Leaf installs **automatically**, you don't have to do anything!

## Manual Installation

This is for when you dont want to run the install script, or you have an unsupported distribution.
